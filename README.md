# poetry on docker

The purpose of this repository is to have an example of how to build a python application with the poetry package manager in a docker container.

**note: and as a bonus, a linter for docker file files has been added.**


## Warning

I'm using alpine image for testing but I recommend you to read this -> https://pythonspeed.com/articles/alpine-docker-python/
